Claude Desktop MCP Environment on Windows – Diagnostics and Failure Modes
Claude Desktop’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) system allows the desktop app to launch local “MCP servers” (plugins/tools) that extend Claude’s capabilities. When developing an MCP (especially one meant to diagnose and fix other MCPs), it’s crucial to understand common failure types on Windows, how Claude handles MCPs, and safe strategies for troubleshooting and remediation. This report categorizes known/likely MCP failure modes on Windows, with root causes, diagnostic methods, and fix recommendations for each. It also covers how Claude Desktop launches and monitors MCPs, and draws parallels to similar plugin ecosystems (like VSCode extensions or language servers) to guide safe fix strategies that respect user approval and data integrity.
Configuration Issues in claude_desktop_config.json
Description: Claude Desktop reads its MCP configuration from a JSON file (claude_desktop_config.json) in the user data directory (on Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
modelcontextprotocol.io
). This file specifies which MCP servers to start and how. Configuration mistakes are a common failure source. Failure Symptoms: If the config JSON is malformed or incorrect, Claude may not launch any MCP servers at startup (no “hammer” or tool icon appears in the Claude UI
modelcontextprotocol.io
). In some cases, the MCP icon appears but specific servers are missing. There may be no immediate UI error, so logs must be checked for clues. Common issues include:
JSON syntax errors: e.g. missing commas/braces or improper string escaping. A typical mistake on Windows is not escaping backslashes in file paths. For example, writing "C:\Users\Name\Desktop" (without doubling \\) will break the JSON parse. This prevents Claude from reading the config at all (no servers start). The official guide explicitly warns to use double backslashes in paths on Windows
github.com
.
Incorrect JSON structure or keys: The file must contain an object with an "mcpServers" field mapping server names to their config. If this key is missing or misspelled, the app will ignore the config. Likewise, each server entry should have a "command" (executable) and "args" (array of arguments). Missing required fields or using wrong types (e.g. providing a string where an array is expected) can cause failures. Claude may log a parse error or silently ignore that entry.
Invalid paths or commands: The JSON might be syntactically valid but point to wrong locations. Examples: a path that doesn’t exist (wrong directory or typo in username), or referencing an executable not in the PATH. Since Claude doesn’t validate paths upfront, these issues manifest at runtime (as startup failures, see next section). However, an obviously invalid path might be caught if the server process fails immediately and logs an error like “No such file or directory”.
Diagnostics: Start by validating the JSON. Open the file in a text editor or JSON linter – any syntax error will be highlighted. Claude’s own troubleshooting guide suggests checking the config file syntax as a first step
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Next, verify each path and command in the config:
Ensure file paths are absolute and correctly escaped. Relative paths will not work
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Use dir (in CMD) or File Explorer to confirm that each directory/file exists. If a path contains spaces (e.g. C:\Program Files\...), note that Claude may treat the command and args as separate parameters (it likely uses a spawn mechanism), so as long as the command and arguments are correctly split in JSON, spaces should be handled. However, if you embed a space in the middle of what Claude thinks is a single command string, it can break. For instance, specifying "command": "C:\Program Files\Node\node.exe" without proper quoting could lead to 'C:\Program' is not recognized... errors in logs
superuser.com
. The safe approach is to provide the path as one string (Claude should handle it), or move executables to paths without spaces if possible.
Ensure the JSON keys are in the right place. All MCP server entries must be under the "mcpServers" object. Also, the config file name and location must be correct – some users have confused it with a different config.json (Claude’s settings) in the same directory, which is unrelated
reddit.com
. Always create/edit claude_desktop_config.json as instructed.
If the MCP icon never appears, it suggests Claude didn’t recognize any valid server config. This could mean the JSON failed to parse or was not placed correctly. Checking the Claude logs (mcp.log) will help: a JSON parse failure might be logged as an error. If parse errors aren’t obvious in logs, try a minimal known-good config (e.g. one server entry from official docs) to see if the icon appears – this isolates whether the issue is the content or the app. Fix Recommendations: For syntax errors, fix JSON formatting (validate with a linter). For path issues, correct the paths to actual installed locations or use environment variables if supported. Always back up the original config before editing, so changes can be rolled back if something goes wrong. A diagnostic MCP tool could automatically detect JSON errors or non-existent paths and propose fixes:
Example: If a path is invalid, suggest “The path X does not exist. Would you like to update it or remove this MCP entry?” – then perform the edit only with user approval. Keep a backup (e.g. save the previous JSON as claude_desktop_config.backup.json) so the user can revert easily.
For unescaped backslashes, the tool can warn “Windows paths in JSON need \\\\ instead of \\. I can fix the formatting for you.” This can be offered as an automatic fix, again with confirmation.
If the JSON is entirely malformed, the diagnostic MCP might refuse to auto-modify (to avoid making things worse) but could point out the error position and guide the user to correct it manually (or offer to open the file in a text editor).
User Approval & Rollback: Emphasize any changes in config will require restarting Claude Desktop to take effect. The diagnostic agent should ask permission to apply changes and perhaps offer to test the new config (for example, by launching the MCP server manually in a safe way) before the user restarts Claude. If the user approves an edit, the tool should save a backup so that if the fix doesn’t help, it can restore the previous config on user request.
MCP Server Startup Failures (Launch/Connection Issues)
Description: Even with a correct config, MCP servers might fail to start or connect properly. Claude Desktop launches each configured MCP server as a separate process when it starts up
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Common failure modes at this stage include the server process not launching at all, launching but immediately crashing, or launching but failing to establish a connection with Claude. Root Causes and Symptoms:
Missing or unrecognized commands: If the "command" in config isn’t found, the process won’t start. For example, if Node.js is not installed or not in the system PATH, using "command": "npx" or "node" will fail (on Windows, you might see an error like 'npx' is not recognized as an internal or external command in the logs). Similarly, if using the uv Python runner without installing it, "uv" will not be found
modelcontextprotocol.io
. In such cases Claude logs might show a failure to execute the command. No MCP icon or a “Could not attach to MCP server…” error might appear. This was commonly reported by users who use Node Version Manager (NVM) or other custom setups – the Claude app often doesn’t inherit those environment settings, so npx/node aren’t found
github.com
.
Command found, but server script errors out: The process starts but exits quickly (before completing MCP initialization). In mcp.log you may see “Initializing server…” followed by a message that the transport closed unexpectedly. For instance, a log excerpt for the Filesystem server on Windows shows it starting and even receiving an initialize message, but then an error 'C:\Program' is not recognized… and the server transport closes unexpectedly
superuser.com
. This particular error was due to a path with a space (likely C:\Program Files\...) not being handled correctly, causing the subprocess to misinterpret the command. The general pattern is: Claude tries to connect (sends an "initialize" JSON-RPC message)
superuser.com
, then the connection drops because the server process died. Claude’s log notes “transport closed unexpectedly, likely due to the process exiting early”
superuser.com
.
Server start but no connection (hanging): If a server launches but does not respond to the initialization handshake, Claude may time out or show “Could not attach to MCP server X”. In logs, you might not see the usual “Server started and connected successfully” message. This can happen if the server process is stuck waiting on something (e.g. awaiting user input in a console, or trying to open a GUI auth window). A known bug as of early 2025 is that Claude Desktop inadvertently starts each MCP server twice
github.com
github.com
. The duplicate process can cause conflicts (like two instances contending for the same resource or port). One user observed two OAuth browser windows opening due to double-start
github.com
. In other cases, double-starting a server that listens on a port leads to immediate port conflict (see Port Conflicts section) and one instance fails. This bug manifests as either two processes in Task Manager or log entries duplicated (e.g. two “Initializing server…” lines). It’s a Claude issue, not a user config error.
Missing dependencies or initialization errors: For example, a Node-based server might crash if it can’t import a module (perhaps the package wasn’t installed correctly). The mcp-server-<name>.log would show a stack trace or “Cannot find module …” error. In one case, an MCP server attempted to load a credentials file and logged Error: Cannot find module 'C:\C:\Users\...gcp-oauth.keys.json' – note the double C:\ indicating a path issue
github.com
. Another example: the Brave Search MCP initially had an issue on Windows where npm couldn’t find the user’s roaming directory due to an environment variable mishandling, causing an ENOENT error pointing to a ${APPDATA} literal path
gist.github.com
. The fix was to explicitly pass the APPDATA env var in the config so the subprocess knows where to look
gist.github.com
.
Diagnostic Strategies:
Check the Claude logs: As soon as Claude Desktop starts (or when you toggle MCP on), open the logs at %APPDATA%\Claude\logs. The main mcp.log will show each server launch attempt and any immediate errors
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Look for lines like “Initializing server…” and “Server [name] started and connected” or error messages. If a server isn’t showing up at all, there might be a syntax/config issue (see previous section). If it starts then stops, you’ll often see a clue in the corresponding mcp-server-{name}.log file (Claude pipes each server’s stderr to such a file)
modelcontextprotocol.io
. For example, if 'npx' is not recognized, that would appear in the server log or main log.
Run the server command manually: Claude’s docs advise this for debugging – open a terminal (CMD) and execute the same command as in the config
modelcontextprotocol.io
. This is extremely useful: it will show any error messages (e.g. missing module, syntax error, permission error) directly in your console. For instance, running the Filesystem server via npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem C:\Users\username\Desktop C:\Users\username\Downloads should either start the server or print an error if something’s wrong
modelcontextprotocol.io
modelcontextprotocol.io
. If the command runs fine manually, but fails via Claude, the difference might be environment (PATH, permissions, etc.). You might then try running Claude as an administrator or adjusting environment variables (see below).
Verify presence of required runtimes: On Windows, most MCP servers are Node.js-based or Python-based:
Node.js: Ensure Node is installed (v18+ recommended
gist.github.com
) and accessible. If launching via npx, test npx --version in CMD. If using NVM, be aware that launching Claude via a shortcut may not load the NVM-provided Node path. This is a known pitfall – many users found that the default npx approach fails with NVM-managed Node
github.com
. One solution is to use absolute paths (e.g. "command": "C:\\Path\\to\\node.exe", "args": ["C:\\Path\\to\\index.js", ...]). By globally installing the MCP server packages and pointing directly to their index.js, you remove reliance on npx and ensure the correct Node binary is used
github.com
stephanmiller.com
. This often resolves startup connection issues. A community “silver bullet” guide emphasizes installing a fresh Node and hardcoding all paths in the config to avoid environment conflicts
medium.com
medium.com
.
Python: If using Python MCP servers, confirm Python 3.10+ is installed and on PATH
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Also, the uv tool (a CLI that simplifies virtual env and running, from Astral) must be installed (e.g. via npm install -g uv on Windows as per instructions
gist.github.com
). If uv isn’t found, the server won’t start. Running uv run yourserver.py manually will show if there are dependency issues (like missing the mcp Python library). Always ensure any needed Python packages (like mcp SDK) are installed in the environment that uv uses
modelcontextprotocol.io
modelcontextprotocol.io
.
Examine environment and permissions: For cases where a command partially executes and fails (e.g. the ${APPDATA} issue or space-in-path issues), environment variables and quoting are suspects. You might try launching Claude Desktop as Administrator (as one step in a Windows fix guide
github.com
) to see if it’s a permission issue. Also, compare the environment in a regular CMD vs what Claude might have. Claude might not pass along certain user environment variables unless explicitly set. In the Brave Search example, adding an env entry in the config for APPDATA resolved an ENOENT error
gist.github.com
gist.github.com
. Similarly, if an API key or other config is needed, ensure it’s provided via the config’s "env": { } for that server (the config supports setting environment vars per server
github.com
github.com
).
Fix Recommendations: The fixes depend on the root cause:
Missing commands: Install the required runtime or tool, or update the config to use the correct path. For example, if npx isn’t working, install the MCP server globally (npm install -g ...) and change the config to call Node directly on the installed package’s script
github.com
. If uv is missing, install it (npm install -g uv) and verify uv is on PATH
gist.github.com
. A diagnostic MCP could detect “command not found” errors in logs and suggest “It looks like the command X is not available. Install X or update the config to point to its location.” The tool might even offer to auto-edit the config to use a found path. For instance, if where node returns a path, offer to replace "command": "node" with the full path to ensure it’s used.
Crashes on startup: Analyze the error output. If it’s a path quoting issue (like the space in Program Files), wrapping the path in quotes in a shell won’t help here because Claude likely uses direct spawn (not a shell). The better fix is to use the "command": "C:\\Progra~1\\NodeJS\\node.exe" 8.3 short path or move the executable. However, a simpler method: avoid spaces in the command by using a symlink or installing to a path without spaces. Alternatively, the diagnostic agent could internally create a short-path alias and adjust the config. This is advanced, so more practically, instruct the user to install Node in a path without spaces or use the NVM approach with absolute path. In the interim, if a server needs a quick fix, one can try creating a small wrapper script that calls the actual command (ensuring proper quoting) and use that as the command in config.
Double-launch bug: As this is an application bug, an MCP cannot directly fix it. The diagnostic MCP should detect the scenario (e.g. by seeing duplicate log entries or two PIDs for the same server) and inform the user. For now, the recommendation is to update Claude Desktop if a fix is released, or apply a workaround. One workaround seen in the community is to modify the config to ensure only one instance runs – for example, using a script/command that checks if the server is already running (like using a lock or in the docker example, using docker attach ... || docker run ... so the second invocation just attaches to the already running container)
github.com
. Such solutions are technical; a safer approach is simply to stop/kill one of the two processes if detected, or restart Claude and hope it doesn’t double-launch (some reported it happens consistently though). The diagnostic agent could prompt: “It appears Claude started the server twice. This can cause conflicts. Until this bug is fixed by Anthropic, you may need to manually close one instance or only run one server at a time.” This is mostly advisory.
General startup failures: The agent can guide the user to perform the manual test (or even automate a dry-run: it could try spawning the same command itself in a controlled way and capture errors). If, for example, the manual run yields a module import error, the fix might be to install the missing module or ensure the correct version. The agent should present any captured stderr output to the user in a readable form and suggest actions (install dependencies, check file paths, provide required API keys, etc.). Always let the user confirm before installing anything or altering system state. For instance, if a package is missing, offer something like: “MCP server X is missing package Y. Would you like me to run npm install -g Y to attempt to fix this?” and ensure they consent.
Safe rollback: If any change (installing a different Node version, altering config paths, etc.) could potentially cause new issues, advise the user to keep track. For example, if switching Node versions to fix one MCP, warn that it could affect others – suggest testing all MCPs after the change, and if it breaks something else, be ready to revert (NVM can easily switch versions back, or have separate Node for Claude vs system). The diagnostic MCP could log all changes it makes and even provide a one-click “undo” if possible (for config edits, restoring backup; for installations, perhaps just note what to uninstall).
Log File Indicators of MCP Issues
Claude Desktop provides log files that are invaluable for diagnosing MCP problems. On Windows, logs reside in %APPDATA%\Claude\logs
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Key log files include:
mcp.log: General MCP subsystem log. This logs the lifecycle of each server connection (startup, handshake messages, errors, disconnects)
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Look here for high-level events like “Connected to MCP server X” or error messages like “Could not attach to MCP server Y”. If a server fails to start or crashes, mcp.log usually notes it (often with the message about the transport closing unexpectedly if the process died).
mcp-server-<name>.log: Individual server logs capturing the stderr output of the server process
modelcontextprotocol.io
. If the MCP server prints errors or stack traces, they will appear here. For example, Node’s uncaught exceptions or console.error calls, or Python’s traceback will be in this file.
Common Log Patterns:
“Server not showing up” scenario: If an MCP server never registers, mcp.log might have nothing about it. That implies a config issue. However, if config was correct and process attempted to launch but failed immediately (e.g., command not found), there may be a one-line error in mcp.log about failing to spawn process. Checking both mcp.log and any mcp-server-*.log created around the same timestamp is useful.
Initialization messages: On a successful start, you’ll see log lines such as [servername] [info] Server started and connected successfully followed by [servername] [info] Message from client: {"method":"initialize", ...}
superuser.com
. These indicate the JSON-RPC handshake between Claude (client) and the server. If you see the initialize message in the log, that means the server process launched and Claude tried to talk to it.
Error messages from server: Any explicit error text (e.g. 'X is not recognized as a command' or 'Error: Cannot find module ...' or stack traces) will typically be in the server log. We saw examples like 'C:\Program' is not recognized...`
superuser.com
, or npm errors with ENOENT and paths
gist.github.com
. Another common pattern is EADDRINUSE (address in use) if a server tries to open a port that’s already taken – this might appear in the server log as a Node error or in Claude’s log if the server fails to bind.
Transport closure messages: Claude logs when a server connection ends unexpectedly: “Server transport closed unexpectedly, this is likely due to the process exiting early.”
superuser.com
. If you see this, it confirms the server crashed or quit. The preceding lines and the server log are crucial to determine why. Conversely, if a server is shut down gracefully, you’d see something like “Client transport closed” without the “unexpectedly” note.
Permission or security issues: If Windows blocked something (like a firewall blocking a port, or execution policy issues for scripts), you might see messages about permission denied. For instance, if a script can’t write to a protected directory, it might log an EACCESS error. Or if using a browser automation MCP (like Puppeteer) without proper setup, the log might mention being unable to launch Chromium due to missing dependencies.
Using Logs for Diagnosis: The diagnostic MCP you’re building can automate log analysis:
It could parse mcp.log for known keywords: “error”, “failed”, “not recognized”, “ENOENT”, “EADDRINUSE”, etc. and highlight relevant lines. For example, if it finds 'not recognized as an internal or external command', it knows an executable wasn’t found – point the user to check installation or PATH for that command. If it finds “EADDRINUSE”, identify that as a port conflict (mention which port if the message includes it).
It can also detect if the handshake never completed. If initialize is sent but no further communication, maybe the server hung; if even initialize isn’t sent, the server probably never started or crashed instantly.
The logs roll over or accumulate per session; ensure the user or tool is looking at the latest entries (the guide suggests using type "%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp*.log" to read them
modelcontextprotocol.io
modelcontextprotocol.io
). The diagnostic agent might offer to open or tail the logs for the user, or present an extracted summary in the chat.
Fix Recommendations via Logs: Each pattern suggests different fixes:
Command not found -> install or correct path (as discussed earlier).
Cannot find module -> ensure the module/package is installed. Possibly run an install command.
Syntax or TypeError in server code -> if it’s a bug in the MCP server code, user might need to update that MCP (check if a newer version exists) or report it. Meanwhile, disable that MCP to avoid crashes.
EADDRINUSE (Port conflict) -> see next section for detailed handling, but essentially choose a different port or stop the conflicting process.
No output at all and just “exited early” -> If there’s zero info, the tool can suggest running in debug mode. Many MCP servers respect a DEBUG env variable (for example, setting DEBUG=mcp:* might enable verbose logs). The gist suggests using DEBUG for troubleshooting
gist.github.com
. The agent could offer to restart the server with debug mode (by adding an env temporarily) to gather more info, with user consent.
Safe Practices: Log files might contain sensitive info (file paths, API keys if printed, etc.), so the diagnostic agent should be careful about exposing them. Only present the minimal needed snippet to the user and possibly mask any sensitive tokens. If uploading logs to an external service for analysis (not likely here, but in general), always ask the user.
Dependency and Compatibility Issues
MCP servers bring their own dependencies (Node packages, Python libraries, or even external programs like Docker or browsers). On Windows, compatibility quirks and version mismatches are a frequent source of trouble. Known Issues and Causes:
Node.js version mismatches: Claude’s MCP servers (especially those from the @modelcontextprotocol repository) generally target Node 18+. Using an older Node can cause syntax errors or failures. Conversely, if Node is too new but a server has an incompatibility, that could also cause issues (less common). Always use a supported Node version (LTS) as recommended
gist.github.com
. If multiple Node versions are installed (e.g., via NVM or other means), Claude might pick up a different one than your default shell, leading to confusion. This is why isolating the environment with NVM was suggested by some, but ironically NVM itself caused path issues if not correctly set up. The key is consistency: ensure the Node that runs under Claude is the one with the needed packages. Using absolute paths as described ensures the correct Node binary and package versions are used
stephanmiller.com
.
Python environment issues: If using Python MCPs, the version matters (Python 3.10+). Multiple Python installs on Windows can cause the uv tool to bind to an unexpected version. The uv CLI likely creates a virtualenv for the project – if the MCP server is not properly installed in that venv, it might not run. Compatibility between the MCP Python SDK and Claude’s MCP protocol version should be considered; ensure you have the latest mcp Python package (the quickstart notes to use SDK 1.2.0 or higher
modelcontextprotocol.io
).
Global vs local installation: Using npx fetches packages on the fly, which introduces potential version drift (each run might get the latest version unless locked). This can break things if an update occurs. Installing globally or pinning versions can improve reliability. However, global installations mean you must update them manually when needed. A compromise is to use a package manager (npm or pip) to manage versions explicitly.
Conflicting dependencies: Less likely since each server runs isolated, but if two MCP servers require different versions of a runtime or library, it can be tricky. For instance, if one MCP requires Node 20 and another only works on Node 18, you can’t satisfy both with a single node.exe. In such advanced cases, one might containerize one of them or run one via a different approach (e.g., use Docker for one server). This is edge-case, but a diagnostic agent could detect if a server fails due to Node unsupported syntax (indicative of version issues) and suggest trying a different Node version for that server specifically.
OS-specific issues: Some MCP servers may not fully support Windows. They might assume POSIX environments. For example, path handling or shell commands might be hardcoded for Unix. The Filesystem MCP and others by Anthropic are designed to work on Windows (via Node) – they mostly use cross-platform APIs. But community MCPs or those invoking CLI tools might have compatibility issues. For instance, a server that calls ls or uses UNIX-style paths would fail on Windows unless adapted. If an MCP server is failing in suspicious ways (like trying to execute a shell script or command not present on Windows), check its documentation or repository for Windows support. You might find issues in their GitHub repo discussing Windows fixes.
Browser-based MCPs (e.g. Puppeteer): The Puppeteer MCP server uses Headless Chrome. On Windows, it should download a Chromium binary automatically. If it fails (due to network issues or a corporate proxy), the server might crash when trying to launch Chrome. The logs would mention something about downloading Chromium or failing to launch it. The fix could be manually installing the appropriate Chrome or adjusting environment (Puppeteer respects PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD or using an existing Chrome via PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH). A diagnostic could notice repeated attempts to download or timeouts and inform the user to check internet connectivity or do a manual install.
Diagnostic Strategies:
Check version requirements: The agent could query the system for node --version and python --version and compare against known requirements. If the Node version is below 18, flag that as likely incompatible. If multiple versions are present, clarify which one is being used (perhaps by printing the Node path from within the server context or checking where node). If the wrong one is invoked, the solution may be to adjust the config to point to the desired version’s executable.
Identify NVM usage: Many users in the community hit issues with NVM (both on Mac and Windows)
github.com
stephanmiller.com
. The agent can detect signs of NVM: e.g., the presence of an .nvm directory in Node paths or environment variables like NVM_HOME. If NVM is detected, and things aren’t working, the agent might suggest the known workaround: globally install the MCP servers and use absolute Node paths
github.com
. We saw this resolved many “Could not attach” errors
stephanmiller.com
stephanmiller.com
. The agent can even automate checking global installations by running npm list -g package-name to see if the server is installed globally. If not, it can suggest installing it.
Environment variable checks: If certain environment vars are crucial (like APPDATA in the earlier example, or PATH including necessary directories), the agent could check what environment Claude passed to the process. This is tricky from within an MCP, but one could spawn a test process that dumps env. Alternatively, rely on clues in error messages (like seeing ${APPDATA} literally means that var wasn’t expanded). If such patterns appear, the fix is to explicitly provide that env var in the config’s "env" for the server
gist.github.com
. The diagnostic MCP could propose adding such an env entry. Safe rollback: adding an env var is low-risk, but still confirm with user.
External tool availability: Some MCPs (e.g., a hypothetical Git MCP might require Git installed, or a database MCP requires the database running) could fail if dependencies aren’t present. The agent should read documentation of known servers and identify if any external programs or services are needed. For example, a Postgres MCP server might assume a local Postgres service. If it can’t connect, Claude might just get errors when using it, not at startup. But the diagnostic could proactively check if the service is reachable (e.g., for a Postgres MCP configured to postgresql://localhost/mydb, try connecting to that DB to verify credentials and that the DB is up).
Fix Recommendations:
Standardize runtime environment: If Node was installed via multiple sources, consider uninstalling duplicates or at least specifying which to use. The “self-contained Node installation” approach
medium.com
medium.com
 suggests using NVM to isolate a clean Node. That can work if done carefully (install fresh Node via NVM, use nvm use in the context Claude runs – which might require launching Claude from an NVM-enabled shell). Alternatively, not using NVM and just installing one system Node might be simpler for less technical users. The report of “most installation failures stem from conflicting Node versions and path issues”
medium.com
 underscores that simplifying to a single known-good Node install is wise.
Align versions of MCP packages: If an MCP server was installed globally at a certain version, and you suspect incompatibility with Claude’s current MCP client version (Claude might expect a certain protocol version – though MCP is supposed to be standardized, changes might occur), try updating the server package. Running npm update -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-name can bring it to the latest. Check the server’s GitHub for release notes; if others have reported similar issues, an update might contain fixes for Windows. Always get user confirmation before updating, and maybe only suggest one at a time to isolate changes.
Use fallback methods if needed: For tricky compatibility issues, sometimes running the MCP server in a Linux environment (WSL or Docker) can circumvent Windows-specific bugs. There’s a blog about getting MCP working in WSL
scottspence.com
. This is advanced, but if a certain MCP just won’t run on Windows (and logs show weird OS errors), the diagnostic might inform the user: “This server appears to have trouble on Windows. As a workaround, you could run it in WSL or a Docker container and configure Claude to connect to it. This requires more setup (advanced).” Only propose this if the user is technical (maybe detect if WSL is installed, etc.). For general users, it might be beyond scope.
Testing after fixes: After any fix (installing a dependency, adjusting a version), have the agent re-run the connection test. Possibly trigger Claude to reload MCP config (Claude Desktop doesn’t have a hot-reload as far as known; you usually restart the app
modelcontextprotocol.io
). The agent could instruct the user: “Please restart Claude Desktop to apply these changes, then we’ll verify if the issue is resolved.” Once restarted, it can check the logs again for success or remaining errors.
Throughout, maintain user agency: don’t uninstall anything without asking, and clearly explain why a certain version or installation is needed. Encourage the user to create system restore points or backups if making big changes (like installing/uninstalling Node or Python), just as VSCode might prompt before changing a major setting.
Port Conflicts and Network Binding Issues
Some MCP servers act as local services that listen on a network port. By default, the MCP specification’s reference implementation often uses port 7777 for local connections (a default transport)
sebastian-petrus.medium.com
. If two processes try to use the same port, or if that port is already occupied, a conflict arises. Scenarios of Port Conflict:
Duplicate server launch: As noted, the Claude double-launch bug can start the same server twice. If the MCP server uses a fixed port (like 7777), the first instance binds it, and the second instance fails with an EADDRINUSE error. The server might crash or refuse the second connection. This would show in logs (e.g. Node’s error “EADDRINUSE: address already in use 127.0.0.1:7777”). The result is likely that the server doesn’t function properly (Claude might only be connected to one of them, or neither if the failure occurs before handshake).
Multiple servers using the same port: If you configure two different MCP servers that by coincidence both default to port 7777 (unless configured otherwise), they can’t run simultaneously. For instance, if one MCP server is a web server and another also starts a server on 7777 without allowing configuration, that’s a conflict. It’s not common for the provided Anthropic servers (they tend to use stdio or dynamic ports), but a third-party server might use a default port. The Brave Search MCP was documented with a default port 7777 usage
sebastian-petrus.medium.com
 – likely it starts a local service for the search proxy. If you also run another MCP with the same default, conflict arises.
Port in use by other application: Port 7777 (or whichever port an MCP uses) might already be taken by another program on the user’s system. For example, some games or local services use 7777
speedguide.net
. If the MCP server doesn’t allow port customization, it will fail. If it does allow, the user can change it – but the config needs to pass that along (maybe via an arg or env).
Firewall or network issues: While not exactly a “conflict,” Windows Defender Firewall might block a server from accepting connections, especially if it’s not purely using stdio. Some MCP servers could be using WebSocket or HTTP communication behind the scenes. If so, the first time they run, Windows might prompt to allow it. If the user declined, the server might start but Claude cannot connect to it (connection refused). In logs it could look like a timeout or “connection error”. Ensuring the server is bound to localhost and not blocked is key. Usually, local loopback is open by default on Windows for local processes, but if the server tries a different interface or if security software intervenes, it can be an issue.
Diagnostics:
Identify port usage: If an MCP server is known to use a port, the diagnostic agent can check if that port is open/occupied. For example, use a netstat command (or a Node library) to see if port 7777 (or any commonly used port for that server) is listening, and by which process. If you find an existing process holding it (perhaps a zombie instance of the MCP or another app), that’s a smoking gun. The agent could list “Process X is already using port Y”.
Check server config for port options: Some MCP servers might allow configuration of their port via arguments. For example, if a server can run as --port 7778 to avoid conflict, the user could add that in the "args". The diagnostic tool should consult documentation (if available) or infer from the server name whether such an option exists. In absence of official docs, the agent might search the installed package files for “7777” to see if it’s hardcoded or configurable.
Look for EADDRINUSE errors in logs: As mentioned, these are clear indicators. If found, pinpoint the port and include that in the report to the user. Sometimes the error might not specify the port in plain text; it could just say “address in use”. If the MCP server name (e.g. brave-search) is known for using 7777, assume that’s it.
Ensure single instance: If double-launch is suspected (two identical logs entries, etc.), after alerting the user, you might attempt to kill the duplicate. A possible (careful) action: the diagnostic agent could detect two PIDs for the same server and ask, “Do you want me to terminate one of the duplicate processes?” This is advanced and risky to automate (killing the wrong process is bad), so likely just inform the user and let them decide (e.g. via Task Manager). The safer approach is to avoid the situation by not launching duplicates – but since that’s on Claude’s side, we can only mitigate.
Fix Recommendations:
Change the port (if possible): If a port conflict is confirmed and the server supports a different port, configure it. For example, if Brave Search MCP allows an env var or arg for port, the agent can suggest “Port 7777 is busy. Shall we try configuring the server to use 7778 instead?” and then modify the config accordingly (adding the arg). This must be tested – after changing, restart Claude and see if the server connects. Rollback is easy (just remove or revert the arg if it fails).
Free up the port: If the conflicting process is something non-essential or another MCP, stopping it solves the issue. The agent can’t force-quit arbitrary apps (that’d violate user control), but it can list the known program using it (e.g. “It appears program ABC is using port 7777. If possible, stop that program while using Claude’s MCP, or change its configuration.”). If the conflict is between two MCPs, the user must decide which one to run at a time, or if one of them allows port change. Document clearly if any MCP has a fixed port design.
Workaround double-start: Until the Claude Desktop bug is fixed, a manual workaround is needed. One approach as mentioned is using a script or Docker to ensure only one instance binds the port
github.com
. Another approach: start the MCP server outside Claude and configure Claude to connect to it (if Claude supports attaching to an already-running server via port or socket). Currently, Claude Desktop doesn’t have a UI for that – it launches them itself. But perhaps one can trick it: if the config’s command is a no-op the second time (like a script that checks and exits if already running). If you are developing the diagnostic MCP, you might incorporate that pattern: i.e., have your diagnostic MCP acquire a lock (like create a temp file lock) so if launched twice it immediately exits the duplicate. That prevents conflict on your diagnostic tool itself.
Firewall solutions: If suspecting firewall issues (e.g. an MCP server that needs to open a browser or a network connection and failing), instruct the user to check Windows Firewall settings. They might need to allow the Claude app or the MCP server process through for local communication. Typically local 127.0.0.1 traffic is not blocked, but if the MCP tries to open a browser window for OAuth (like Google or GitHub servers might), Windows might block the popup or the callback server. The fix might be to mark the Claude app as a trusted app or temporarily disable firewall for testing. Always get user consent and let them do it (just guide them; an MCP should not change firewall settings on its own).
Respecting Safety: Port conflicts resolution can inadvertently expose services if not careful (e.g. changing to a different port might be fine, but ensure it’s still bound to localhost and not a public interface). If suggesting to run Claude as administrator to avoid certain issues (sometimes needed for binding to low ports or for Docker), warn the user of the implications. Only elevate privileges if absolutely needed and with user agreement.
Claude Desktop’s MCP Architecture on Windows
Understanding how Claude Desktop manages MCPs on Windows helps target our diagnostics:
File Locations: Claude Desktop (an Electron-based app) stores data in %APPDATA%\Claude\ on Windows
modelcontextprotocol.io
reddit.com
. The claude_desktop_config.json lives here, and logs reside in the logs\ subfolder
modelcontextprotocol.io
. If the config file doesn’t exist, Claude creates one when you first click “Edit Config” in the Developer settings
modelcontextprotocol.io
. (On Mac, paths are under ~/Library/Application Support/Claude, but we focus on Windows.)
Launching MCP Servers: When Claude Desktop starts (or when you add a config and restart), it reads the JSON and for each entry under "mcpServers", it spawns a process using the specified command and arguments
modelcontextprotocol.io
. These processes run with the same user privileges as Claude (no sandbox beyond that), so they have access to your files equal to your user permissions
modelcontextprotocol.io
. This is powerful, which is why one should only add trusted servers. Claude likely uses a standard child process spawn (without a shell) to launch servers. The protocol communication is established either via STDIO pipes or via network sockets. The official MCP example servers often call mcp.run(transport='stdio') in code
modelcontextprotocol.io
, meaning they communicate through STDIN/STDOUT. Claude connects to these streams for JSON-RPC. Some servers could use a different transport (like WebSocket on a port); if so, Claude would connect to that (the protocol spec allows various transports
modelcontextprotocol.io
, and local IPC is possible). For most cases, assume STDIO unless documentation says otherwise.
Monitoring and Heartbeats: Claude’s logs show a continuous connection once a server is up. It’s not fully documented how Claude monitors health – but given logs mention “server transport closed”, Claude detects if the pipe/socket closes
superuser.com
. There may not be an active heartbeat ping, but any attempt by Claude to call a tool would quickly reveal if the server is unresponsive. If a server crashes, Claude does not auto-restart it (at least not currently). The user would have to restart the whole app or toggle MCP off and on (if such UI exists). In the future, they might add auto-reconnect, but none is noted in docs.
Logs and Developer Tools: Claude Desktop has a Developer Mode in settings that, when enabled, makes it easier to access logs
medium.com
. It adds a quick button to open the MCP log file
medium.com
. This implies that typically the user would troubleshoot via logs as we’ve described. The diagnostic MCP can leverage this by either telling the user to enable Developer Mode or by directly reading the log files (if the MCP has file system access – note: there is an MCP Filesystem tool which, if enabled, could read logs for us. If our diagnostic MCP runs alongside it or includes similar privileges, it could open the log directory directly).
File structure and naming: When an MCP server is defined, the key in the JSON (e.g. "filesystem", "github") is used to name the log file (mcp-server-filesystem.log). This key also identifies the server in the UI (Claude will list tools under that name). The name is arbitrary for user-defined servers but usually corresponds to the functionality. Knowing the name helps parse logs and also to possibly send specific instructions to Claude (for instance, telling Claude to use a certain tool by name in conversation triggers it to call that MCP).
Approval mechanism: Claude Desktop integrates a permission system for MCP actions. When an MCP server tries to perform a tool action (like read a file or open a webpage), Claude will ask the user for approval in the chat UI
modelcontextprotocol.io
modelcontextprotocol.io
. This ensures safety. For our diagnostic MCP, this means if it tries to fix something on the user’s behalf (like editing a file or installing software), it should similarly request confirmation. Ideally, leverage the same mechanism: e.g., if the diagnostic MCP is implemented as an MCP server with certain tool functions (like “editConfig” or “runCommand”), invoking those will prompt the user to allow it. This provides a natural check and a chance for the user to decline or review changes.
Community tooling: There is mention of an MCP Inspector tool that helps debug MCP communications
superuser.com
. If the user tried that and it couldn’t connect, it means the MCP subsystem was not functional at all in that scenario. But such tools (Inspector, or an MCP CLI client
github.com
) indicate an ecosystem of debugging. The diagnostic MCP could take inspiration from those to intercept or log the JSON-RPC messages for deeper analysis (though that might be overkill for this context).
In summary, Claude Desktop on Windows runs MCPs as child processes, logs their output, and relies on the config file to know what to run. It doesn’t provide fine-grained control (start/stop individual servers from the UI is not currently there – it’s all based on the config and app restarts). Knowing this, any fix that requires changing an MCP’s runtime (like different Node version or adding env vars) will typically necessitate editing the config and restarting Claude. The diagnostic MCP should make the user aware of that cycle.
Community Insights and Real-World Issues
The MCP feature is new and evolving (many sources are from late 2023 and 2024), so community forums and GitHub issues are rich resources:
GitHub Issues – Model Context Protocol Repos: The official MCP servers repository has numerous issue reports from users. For example, Issue #75 on modelcontextprotocol/servers specifically addressed Windows filesystem MCP setup problems
github.com
. It identified that using npx with NVM on Windows fails to connect and provided a solution (install globally + use absolute node paths)
github.com
. We cited parts of this; it’s essentially a step-by-step fix that became a community reference. Likewise, Issue #812 discussed Claude Desktop launching servers twice (the double-start bug) with contributions from multiple developers noting the confusion it causes
github.com
. Keeping an eye on those issues (and their resolution status) is important. If you were coding a diagnostic MCP, you might even have a hardcoded check: “if Claude version <= X and issue #812 not closed, watch out for double launch.”
Reddit Discussions: On r/ClaudeAI, users have shared experiences. One user described how nothing worked until they realized they needed to create the config file and use the Developer settings properly
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Another thread “How do I access MCP?” had the NVM solution we discussed: the user padioca eventually solved it by applying Windows-specific fixes on Mac, and another user found that using the package name without the @modelcontextprotocol scope worked for them
reddit.com
. That latter point (“I used mcp-server-brave-search instead of @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search”) suggests that perhaps there’s a difference in how npx handles scoped packages on Windows – using the installed binary name vs. the scope name. It’s an interesting tidbit: if npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search is done, the binary might be exposed as mcp-server-brave-search (a shorter name) on the PATH. So running mcp-server-brave-search could invoke it directly. This is a nuance the diagnostic might incorporate: if a user’s config is failing with @modelcontextprotocol/server-foo, try the alternative command name (which might be mcp-server-foo) as a suggestion.
Blog Posts and Tutorials: We saw Medium articles (by Kaue Cano

) detailing troubleshooting steps. They uniformly highlight:
Installing Node via NVM or other means but then encountering issues,
The frustration of “Could not attach to MCP server X” errors,
And the ultimate fix of using global installs and hardcoded paths. Stephan Miller even mentions trying a wrapper for NVM which didn’t help
stephanmiller.com
 – reinforcing that simplifying the environment was the key. These sources validate our categories of issues (config path, Node env) and provided resolution examples we’ve included. Citing them in a help context can reassure users that these are common issues with known fixes, not just personal system flukes.
GitHub Gist “MCP-Windows”: This community-maintained gist

 compiles step-by-step instructions for Windows MCP setup. It echoes official advice and user discoveries: Node 18+, Python 3.10+, install uv, install core servers globally
gist.github.com
. It also has a Troubleshooting section that specifically calls out the “Could not attach” error and suggests verifying paths and using dir to ensure correctness
gist.github.com
. It even demonstrates adding APPDATA to fix the ENOENT issue and recommends running npm cache clean if npm registry returns weird errors

. This gist is a goldmine of real-world fixes. A diagnostic MCP could incorporate checks from that guide (e.g., after applying fixes, use npm cache clean --force if network fetch errors are suspected, as per the gist comment
gist.github.com
).
Similar Ecosystems: The concept of MCP is analogous in some ways to Visual Studio Code’s extension + Language Server model:
Extensions in VSCode can fail to activate due to missing dependencies or incorrect configuration. VSCode surfaces these failures with messages and logs in an Output channel for the extension. It doesn’t auto-edit user settings; it might prompt the user to install a missing tool or enable a feature. We can mirror this user-centric approach: inform and guide, but let the user decide on changes.
Language servers (LSP) are external processes similar to MCP servers. VSCode often will attempt to restart a crashed language server a few times. After several crashes, it will stop trying and show an error to the user. This progressive retry with a limit is a pattern to consider – our diagnostic MCP could attempt to restart a misbehaving MCP once or twice if it thinks it can succeed (for example, after applying a config fix, try launching it again), but not loop indefinitely. And always inform the user what it’s doing (“Attempting to restart the server... attempt 1 of 2”).
Extensions typically store backup of user preferences when migrating versions or can disable themselves if they cause repeated crashes. Similarly, if one MCP consistently crashes and the user can’t fix it now, the diagnostic tool might offer to temporarily disable that MCP (by commenting it out of config or removing it) so that Claude runs without it. This is akin to how a browser might disable an add-on that causes stability issues. Safe rollback: Keep track of what was disabled so it can be re-enabled later easily.
User Agency and Data Integrity: In all community guidance, there’s an implicit trust that the user is making changes knowingly (since they’re editing JSON or installing software). Our MCP diagnostic can increase safety by building on lessons from others:
Always ask before changing anything. E.g., “I can try to fix the JSON syntax. Proceed?” or “Shall I install Node.js now?” – and perhaps provide a link or reference if they want to do it themselves instead.
Provide a preview of changes when possible. If editing a config file, show the diff (which lines will change) in the chat and confirm.
Backup files: automatically save a backup of claude_desktop_config.json with a timestamp whenever modifying it. If something goes wrong, user can restore it.
If running commands (like installations), prefer ones that are non-destructive and explain them. For example, npm install -g is additive; if something fails, it generally doesn’t break existing setups (other than adding a package). Still, advise “You can uninstall this later with npm uninstall -g if needed.”
If the fix involves sensitive data (like adding an API key to config), ensure the user is comfortable. The diagnostic could detect if an API key is blank when required (the config template for e.g. GitHub has "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "" by default
github.com
). The agent can remind the user to fill it in, but should not attempt to obtain it itself (that’s user’s responsibility for security).
By incorporating these insights, a diagnostic MCP will not only address known failure types but do so in a user-friendly, transparent manner. The community’s experiences effectively map out the “gotchas” and best practices which we’ve compiled and can leverage to make MCP usage on Claude Desktop much more robust.
Summary Table: Error Types, Diagnosis, and Fixes
For quick reference, the table below maps common MCP failure types to detection methods and recommended fixes:
Failure Type	How to Detect (Symptoms/Logs)	Root Cause & Fix Recommendation
Config JSON Syntax Error	No MCP icon; Claude logs show parse errors or no mention of MCP	Malformed claude_desktop_config.json. Fix: Validate JSON, correct formatting (e.g. add missing commas, escape backslashes
github.com
). Test with a minimal valid config.
Invalid Paths in Config	MCP not appearing; log may show “file not found” or '... not recognized' errors when launching command
superuser.com
.	Paths to executables or directories are wrong or not absolute
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Fix: Update paths to correct, absolute ones. Use where (Windows) to find executables
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Double-check that paths exist with dir.
Executable Not Found (e.g. npx/uv)	Log: 'X' is not recognized as an internal or external command or similar. No “Server started” message.	Required runtime not installed or not in PATH. Fix: Install Node or Python/uv as needed
gist.github.com
gist.github.com
. Or use full path in config (e.g. to node.exe)
github.com
. Ensure Claude can access it (if using NVM, use absolute path to NVM’s Node).
MCP Server Crashes at Start	Log: “transport closed unexpectedly… process exiting early”
superuser.com
. Server log shows error (e.g. exception, cannot find module, syntax error).	Server threw an error on launch. Fix: Address specific error – e.g. install missing module (run npm install -g for that server)
github.com
, update Node/Python version, correct code bug if DIY server. After fix, restart Claude and check logs for successful “connected” message.
“Could not attach to MCP server X” UI error	Claude UI shows an error banner; logs may show handshake attempt then nothing further.	Generic attach failure – often due to the Node environment issue (NVM path) or server crashing before init. Fix: Use the “silver bullet” approach: globally install servers and hardcode Node paths
medium.com
stephanmiller.com
. Verify using manual run of server. This resolves most attach issues reported by users.
Double Launch (Duplicate Process)	Two identical log sequences for one server; two OS processes seen; port conflict errors (EADDRINUSE) in logs.	Claude bug causing two instances. Fix: Update Claude Desktop when patch is available. Interim: kill one instance manually, or use a script in config to prevent second launch
github.com
. Diagnostic MCP should warn user of this issue
github.com
.
Port Conflict (EADDRINUSE)	Server log: “address already in use” (with port number) error. Server fails to start or crashes on bind.	Another process (or duplicate) is using the port (default MCP port 7777
sebastian-petrus.medium.com
). Fix: If server supports custom port, configure it to a free port. Otherwise, free the port (stop other service). Ensure only one instance runs. Possibly use netstat/Get-NetTCPConnection to find conflicts.
Missing API Keys / Env Vars	Server runs but functionality fails (Claude gets errors calling it). Logs or Claude responses indicate “unauthorized” or similar. E.g. Brave Search MCP returns error if API key missing.	User forgot to set required credentials. Fix: Edit config to add the API key or token under the server’s "env" settings
github.com
. Never auto-fetch user credentials; just prompt them to input and restart.
Permission Denied / Access Errors	Server log shows EACCES or “permission denied” trying to read/write a file or open a network port below 1024.	The MCP attempted an action beyond current permissions. Fix: Run Claude as admin only if necessary (e.g. if accessing admin-only files)
github.com
. Preferably, adjust the MCP to operate in allowed areas (e.g. use user directory paths). For network, use allowed ports or open firewall for that app if it’s safe.
Dependency Version Mismatch	Subtle issues: e.g. Python MCP throws errors due to older mcp library not supporting protocol version (Claude uses protocol 2024-11-05). Or Node package out-of-date.	Incompatible versions of tools. Fix: Upgrade the MCP server package to latest compatible version. Check MCP server release notes. If protocol mismatch, update the MCP SDK (pip or npm update). Ensure Python MCP SDK is v1.2.0+ if Claude uses new protocol
modelcontextprotocol.io
.
Silent Failures / No Output	Claude calls the tool, nothing happens, and no error shown, or output is empty. Logs might not show an obvious error.	Could be the MCP server running but failing internally (e.g. returning nothing or swallowing an error). Fix: Enable debug logging for that server (set DEBUG env as suggested
gist.github.com
 or run in verbose mode if supported). This may reveal the issue. Additionally, test the tool outside Claude if possible (call its API or function directly). Once identified, apply appropriate fix (could range from code patch to environment fix).

Best Practices from Similar Systems for Safe Fixes
Designing a “self-healing” or diagnostic MCP should take cues from mature plugin systems:
User in Control: Like VSCode or browser extensions, never fix or change settings without user consent. Provide information and one-click actions, but allow the user to decline or do it manually. For instance, VSCode shows a notification “Extension X requires tool Y. Install now?” – user can choose. We should do the same for installing Node, cleaning cache, etc.
Non-Destructive Changes: Emulate how OS updaters or installers create backups/restore points. For example, if modifying claude_desktop_config.json, create a backup first (and tell the user where it’s saved). If a fix fails or the user is unhappy, they can restore the previous state easily.
Incremental Fixes: Don’t stack multiple changes at once; apply one fix, then test. This mirrors how one would troubleshoot manually and how some IDEs approach refactoring – step by step with testing. For example, if an MCP isn’t connecting, the tool might first try to fix the PATH issue and ask the user to restart Claude. Only if that’s confirmed fixed do we move to the next issue. This prevents compounding problems and helps isolate what solved it.
Logging and Transparency: The diagnostic MCP itself should log its actions and findings (perhaps to its own log file or the chat). That way, the user has a record of what was changed. Similar to how package managers log changes or VSCode shows what settings it changed when you use a settings GUI.
Safe Defaults and Rollback: If unsure about a risky action, lean towards a conservative approach. For example, instead of outright deleting a problematic server entry, perhaps comment it out (if JSON had a comment mechanism – it doesn’t, so maybe move it to a backup section or just advise the user to remove it rather than doing it automatically). Always have a path to undo. In worst case, instruct the user how to revert (e.g. “if this update caused new issues, you can reinstall the previous Node version via...”).
Test in Sandbox: If possible, test changes in an isolated manner. For instance, to check if a config edit will work, the diagnostic MCP could try launching the MCP server itself (as a child process) with the new parameters before writing them to config. If it launches and responds to an init ping successfully, then we know the change is good and can write to config. This is akin to how some systems verify a configuration file’s validity before using it (for example, Nginx -t to test config). While not all MCP issues allow such testing, it’s a powerful technique to avoid applying bad changes.
Learning from Language Servers: Some LSP clients back off restarting a crashing server repeatedly to avoid loops. Our agent, if it tries something like restarting a server after a fix, should not keep doing so if it fails multiple times – instead, mark it as needs user attention. Also, consider offering the user the ability to disable a problematic MCP server (like how you can disable a VSCode extension) to regain a working base state, then fix that MCP separately.
Security Considerations: A diagnostic tool could potentially do sensitive operations (reading logs, changing files, running commands). Ensure all such actions trigger Claude’s user approval workflow (which they will if implemented as MCP tools). Do not override that – it’s a feature. And ensure any command executed is safe (e.g. if constructing a command with user input, validate it to prevent injection). Essentially, follow the principle of least surprise: the user should always know what’s happening and why, and nothing should compromise their system or data without explicit permission.
By adhering to these practices, we can significantly reduce the risk of the “fix” causing more harm than the initial issue. The goal is a reliable, user-trusting diagnostic MCP that empowers the user to solve MCP server issues in Claude Desktop on Windows with confidence. References:
